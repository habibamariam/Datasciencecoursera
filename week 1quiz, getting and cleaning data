pwgtp15
broken down by sex. Using the data.table package, which will deliver the fastest user time?

mean(DT[DT$SEX==1,]$pwgtp15); mean(DT[DT$SEX==2,]$pwgtp15)

DT[,mean(pwgtp15),by=SEX]

mean(DT$pwgtp15,by=DT$SEX)

rowMeans(DT)[DT$SEX==1]; rowMeans(DT)[DT$SEX==2]

tapply(DT$pwgtp15,DT$SEX,mean)

sapply(split(DT$pwgtp15,DT$SEX),mean)
